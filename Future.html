<h2>The Future of Augmented Reality</h2>
<h4><i>
"AR is gonna take a little while, because there’s some really hard technology challenges 
there. But it will happen. It will happen in a big way. And we will wonder, when it does 
[happen], how we lived without it. Kind of how we wonder how we lived without our [smartphones] 
today." <br />
- Tim Cook

</h4>

<p> 
With the capabilities of bridging the gap between digital and reality, Augmented Reality 
has the potential to become even more accessible and prominent in people’s everyday lives, 
as it becomes more and more mainstream. 
</p>

<h3>Commercial Uses</h3>
<p>
Although online shopping has already become extremely widespread, AR could bring this 
experience to another level. Many companies have been discussing and working to develop a 
method of allowing customers to test and try-on products through visual projections of the 
object providing a better experience for online shoppers.

</p>

<h3>Digital Marketing Uses</h3>
<p>
With new development among the digital and technological industry, many companies such as 
Qualcomm, see a great future in the capabilities of AR gaming. Much of the technology that 
we use today employs the use of 2D visuals, and some who push the boundaries of 3D such as 
Pokemon Go, but in the future, many industries will start employing AR into actual 3D uses 
for more immersive experiences among its users. 
</p>

<h3>Educational</h3>
<div id="education">
<p>
Although Augmented Reality has not become prevalent among the educational field, it has 
limitless potentials. Through AR, educators in classrooms could project 3D images, merge 
presentations with live projection demonstrations, etc. This not only allows for a more 
immersive experience among students, but also enhances their abilities to understand and 
engage with that they are learning.
