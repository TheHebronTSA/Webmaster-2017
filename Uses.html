<h2>Current Uses of Augmented Reality</h2>

<p>
<div id="info">
<h4>Military Industry</h4>
	<ul> 
			<li>Assist men and women who need to make repairs on the field</li>
			<li>HUD - the Heads Up Display utilizes a transparent display that allows the user to see additional data along with the information already presented without looking away from the screen.</li>
				<li>HUDs In aircrafts to help dictate airspeed, horizon lines, and other important information for a pilot while also allowing for minimal head movement.</li>
	</ul>
	<div id="images"><img src="images/Military Industry.jpg" width="400px"></div>
<h4>Gaming industry</h4>
	<ul> 
			<li>Provide a more vivid experience while outside or inside the video game, providing more entertaining, realistic, and visuals with more polygons. Through the non stop expansion of the gaming industry, AR has the possibility to provide unprecedented levels of of immersion. </li>
			<li>Pokemon go is the perfect example of AR, as it combines the concept of catching mystical creatures and collecting them, with the aspect of actually going outside to become a Pokemon trainer. </li>
	
	</ul>
<h4>Navigation</h4>
	<ul>
			<li>GPS is now an extremely commonplace tool that helps people navigate between locations. However, all GPS require people to take their eyes off the road in order to see directions. However, through the integration of AR, some companies are working to create 3D navigation to solve this problem.
			</li>
	</ul>
<div id="images"><img src="images/Navigation.jpg" width="400px"></div>
<h4>Sightseeing</h4>
	<ul>
			<li>Almost all smartphones are equipped with a camera, allowing all tourists to have access to AR aided tours. Many companies have developed apps to augment live view displays in order to provide more information and interactive capabilities to museums and their exhibits.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Google maps - Allows for the touring and live view of museums, monuments </li>
				<li>Total immersion - global leader of AR - is enhancing museum tour experiences with AR</li>
				<li>Perot Museum uses the Beam Bot to allow kids at the Scottish Rite Children's hospital to tour the museum through a robot that provides interactive AR</li>

			</ul>
	</ul>
<h4>Medical</h4>
	<ul>
			<li>All surgeons have to start somewhere, and AR can provide Medical students with the opportunity of practicing surgeries in a controlled environment.  AR can provide sensory enhancements for surgeons such as Projecting 3D images of body parts onto patient'sâ€™ actual anatomy in order to compare.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>This tech can be combined with MRI or x rays to allow for easier access of information for a doctor.</li>
			</ul>
	</ul>
<h4>Social Networks</h4>
	<ul>
			<li>
			Social media has exploded in recent years, and AR has also become extremely prevalent 
			in many mainstream social media applications such as Snapchat, Instagram, etc. 
			These applications all utilize augmented reality to create filters, addons, and 
			other types of virtual capabilities to photos and videos. 
			</li>
	</ul>
<h4>Education</h4>
	<ul>
			<li>Although AR has not yet become prevalent in many classroom environments, it has slowly become more and more developed in hopes that one day it may be widely integrated into schools. Currently, many apps are being developed to utilize AR in education to enhance learning experiences. 
			</li>
			<li>Students can use open source tools to enhance their learning in classrooms</li>
