<h2>Technology Student Association at Hebron High School</h2>

<h3>What is TSA?</h3>
<p>
Technology Student Association, or TSA, is a national <br />
organization that is directed towards teaching <br />
middle and high school students valuable technical <br />
lessons that can help them succeed in today’s heavily <br />
technology based world. TSA promotes leadership, <br />
competitive, and teamwork skills as students compete <br />
in events, participate in community service projects, <br />
and work together as one chapter to strengthen.

<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
<p>
TSA fosters personal growth, leadership, and opportunities 
in technology, innovation, design, and engineering. Members 
apply and integrate STEM concepts through co-curricular 
activities, competitions, and related programs. 
</p>
<br />
<h3>History of Hebron TSA</h3>
<p>
Hebron’s TSA Chapter launched in 1999, the same year the high school opened. 
Engineering and Architectural Design instructor, Dale Rodgers, was the first 
and remains the current advisor of the school’s chapter. With just 8 members in 
1999, the team has grown tremendously in size and skill as it presently has 95 
members and is only looking to expand. The idea behind bringing TSA to Hebron 
was the want for an extracurricular club that encouraged technical and STEM 
(science, technology, engineering, math) based classes, promoted leadership 
development, and included the competitive aspect.

<h3>Chapter Activities</h3>
<p>
Annually, Hebron’s TSA Chapter participates in a fundraiser to raise money for transportation fees, refreshments, t-shirt money, and more. This year, the chapter partnered with the company, Seitz, to sell high quality products such as barbecue seasonings, gourmet coffees, and meat. 
</p>

<h3>Community Projects</h3>
<p>
To develop leadership skills and gain community service experience, Hebron’s TSA Chapter participates in the district-wide “Big Event.” This year, the chapter is collaborating with Metrocrest Services, a program that provides assistance to those in need. They will be going to aid a senior citizen with tasks they can’t perform or afford such as fixing a driveway, building fences, and other yard work.
