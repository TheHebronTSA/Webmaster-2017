<h2>Benefits and Concerns of Augmented Reality</h2>

<h3>Benefits</h3>

<p>
As with any growing technology, augmented reality appeals to an extensive portion of the 
population. One of the biggest benefits of augmented reality is the potential to conduct 
virtual experiments and save money during the “trial and error” phase of a project. For 
example, construction workers can virtually test various building designs without ever 
having to lay an actual brick, saving them the cost of tearing down structures, wasting 
supplies, and starting over. <br />

Also, the technology can be customized to suit people’s needs. For example, it can provide 
individuals with coupons to frequently visited stores, notify them when certain stores are 
less crowded, and provide information on tourist sites and landmarks. <br />

Furthermore, it provides an alternative to using small screened cell phones for looking 
up information. Data can now be projected, making it easier to see and interact with. <br />

Finally, augmented reality offers assistance where it may be lacking. For instance, it 
can help online shoppers make decisions by allowing them to visualize how a clothing item, 
pair of glasses, or piece of furniture will look before impulsively buying it.

<h3>Concerns</h3>

<p>

However, there are several concerns related to the rise and increasing use of augmented 
reality. Many wonder if this new technology is actually worth its benefits. What sacrifices 
will users have to make in order to enjoy this advanced system?<br />

People argue that overlaying multiple visuals can be distracting to drivers and pilots, 
causing car and plane crashes. The game Pokemon Go alone has caused several car accidents 
this past year. This technology may be hazardous to people’s personal safety.<br />

Along with many other forms of technology, augmented reality poses a major risk to one’s 
personal privacy. In order to function, the system has to gather an extensive amount of 
information on a person’s surroundings, hobbies, family, and locations. Hackers can break 
into these systems and use the collected data to stalk certain people. Similarly, a company 
could tap into more personal and private information, such as social security numbers and 
passwords. Hackers can also mess with the systems and project false information such as 
fake speed limits, road signs, and traffic to drivers. <br />
	
Finally, a smaller but still important concern of augmented reality is the notion that 
people will miss out on valuable experiences that are happening right in front of them. 
They can get caught up in the blend of the real world and virtual technology, but actually 
fail to notice live events.
